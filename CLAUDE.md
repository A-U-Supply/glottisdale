# Glottisdale — Project Instructions

## Testing
- Always write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Run tests and confirm they pass before committing

## Git Workflow
- NEVER commit or push directly to main/master
- Always use feature branches, push to remote, open a PR, and merge via the PR workflow

## Documentation
- Keep `README.md` and `docs/` up to date and in sync with new features and feature changes
- Update docs as part of the same branch/PR that introduces the change
